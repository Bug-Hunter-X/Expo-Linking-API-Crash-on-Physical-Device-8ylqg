This repository contains a bug report and solution for an issue encountered when using the Expo Linking API on physical devices. The issue is that the app crashes silently when attempting to open a URL using Linking.openURL(), while the same code works perfectly on simulators. The solution involves checking the URL validity and handling potential errors using try-catch blocks and more robust error handling within the Linking API.  This approach enhances the app's stability and provides a better user experience.
